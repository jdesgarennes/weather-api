## Weather Dashboard



## description:
The following App is a simple weather dashboard that accepts a user input to search a weather forcast for the current day. It will then show a group of cards that has the 5 day forcast. The current weather and 5 day forcasr will utilize two different api calls from openweathermap.org. The firs api call gets current temp, humidity, wind, city name, and the Icon representing current weather state. The second API gets weather forcast for the same values with other api and populates cards. In addition to this the current date for each card and current weather is displayed.
